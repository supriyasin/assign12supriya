    "\n",
    "\"\"\"The re.compile() fuction returns Regex objects.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#2. Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Raw strings are used so that backslashes do not have to be escaped.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#3. What is the return value of the search() method?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"The search() method returns Match objects.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#4. From a Match item, how do you get the actual strings that match the pattern?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"The group() method returns strings of the matched text.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#5. In the regex which created from the r'(\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)&#39;, what does group zero cover?\n",
    "Group 2? Group 1?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Group 0 is the entrie match, group 1 covers the first set of parentheses, and group 2\n",
    "   covers the second set of parantheses.\"\"\"\n",

    "#6. In standard expression syntax, parentheses and intervals have distinct meanings. How can you tell\n",
    "a regex that you want it to fit real parentheses and periods?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Periods and parantheses can be escaped with a backslash: \\., \\(,and\\).\"\"\"\n",

    "the two options?\n",

    "#9. In regular expressions, what does the character stand for?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"The ? character can either mean \"match zero or one of the preceding group\"\n",
